# Day 9: Secret Auction Project

On Day 9, we created a **secret auction** program. This simulates a real-life auction where multiple bidders submit secret bids without knowing others' amounts. The highest bidder wins, just like in real-life secret auctions.

## What We Learned

- Using **dictionaries** to store biddersâ€™ names and their bids.
- Managing **user input** in a loop to allow multiple bidders.
- Writing **functions** to process data, like finding the highest bid.
- Controlling program flow with **loops and conditionals**.
- Working with **basic data structures** to simulate real-world applications.

## How the Code Works

- The program asks each bidder for their name and bid amount, storing this data in a dictionary.
- It repeats this process until no more bidders want to join.
- Then, a function scans the dictionary to find the highest bid and announces the winner.
- The screen is cleared between bidders (using new lines) to keep bids secret.
